# Hierarchies

In Power BI, a hierarchy is a structured relationship between columns in a table representing different granularity levels within a dataset. 
Hierarchies enable drill-down and drill-up interactions, allowing users to navigate through data at various levels of detail. By creating hierarchies, you can facilitate more intuitive and efficient data exploration.

The most common examples of hierarchies in Power BI are:

Date Hierarchy:

- Year > Quarter > Month > Day
- Allows users to analyze data over time, drilling down from years to specific days.

Geographical Hierarchy:

- Country > State/Province > City
- Facilitates geographical analysis by drilling down from countries to individual cities.

Product Hierarchy:

- Category > Subcategory > Product
- Useful for analyzing sales or performance of products at different levels of detail.

Organizational Hierarchy:

- Department > Team > Employee
- Helps analyze organizational data, allowing users to navigate through different levels of departments and teams.

## Hierarchies in Factures Data

Regarding our data on Factures, which hierarchies do we have? In which tables?

Dim_tipo_cliente and Dim_facturas have two possible hierarchies, one regarding dates and the other, geographical data.

What does it mean to do drill down? When we define a hierarchy and use this field in a visualization, such as a plot or a table, we can analyze measure aggregations at different levels. For example, the total number of items sold by year, month or day.


## Data categories

Before defining hierarchies it is important to parametrize the data category of some variables.

Open Dim_clientes in the Table Tab and click on region column, and input the data category of this column as State or Province

Now categorize Pais as a country, and Ciudad as a City.

In table Dim_facturas repeat the process for the date columns, Now, Year, Quarter, Month and Day columns created before are useful!! Probably this hierarchy was automatically created

## How to define a hierarchy 

Now on the right-data menu select the highest hierarchy level, Country in our case, and click on the 3 points 路路路 and create a hierarchy

Then add Region and Ciudad to the Pais hierarchy

Congrats!! you have created your first hierarchy in Power BI

## Hierarchies in visualizations

To build this visualization (we will explain deeper). In the visualization menu click on Matix, insert the date hierarchy in rows and a measure in Values

Then expand the "+" buttons in the years, then quarters... and analyze what happens

Above the table, we have 4 arrows (blue). These are the commands to drill up and down.

- Starting for the right ![image](https://github.com/bvzq/Bussines-Intelligence-Course/assets/74789933/f78afead-f0b1-45a4-9c58-6b62f215fedc) (Expand all down one level in hierarchy) will open the next level for each category.
In the first case, it will open the four quarters per year, if you click there once again will open all the months per quarter, and so on.

-  Second arrow ![image](https://github.com/bvzq/Bussines-Intelligence-Course/assets/74789933/d972a747-e68b-4f5b-abb8-d52245d730a6) (Go to the next level in the hierarchy) will open and show the aggregations by quarters, regardless of the year. So it will show the addition of the costs by Quarters, mixing Q1 from year 2019, 2020 and 2021. The Grand Total is equal in both examples

-  Third arrow from the right ![image](https://github.com/bvzq/Bussines-Intelligence-Course/assets/74789933/8c7dbaa1-928e-487f-a44d-cac3b7d1a427) (Drill mode is on: click a data point to drill) allows to fix one item, like filtering. For example, if you click in 2019, then in one of the first or second arrows, the aggregation shown will only consider this year.

- The fourth arrow is to drill up and return to the beginning. 

## Mini exercise!!

Create a Matrix, visualize it and analyze geospatial hierarchies. Also, you can see what happens if you define other types of visualization, like a column chart


## Other utilities for hierarchies

City names, around the globe, are not unique. For example, C贸rdoba in Spain and Argentina. So defining the Country, Region and city categories and hierarchies will help PowerBI to recognize which city in the world you want to represent in a Map.

It is common to make a mistake in representing geospatial points in a Map
